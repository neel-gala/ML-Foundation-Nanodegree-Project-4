# ML-Foundation-Nanodegree-Project-4

Boston Data Analysis:
Purpose: To Predict Boston Housing Prices
In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 490 entries represent aggregated data about 4 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts.

Pre-requisites:
1. Python 2
2. HTML Viewer

Steps to run the Python code:
1. Open Anaconda
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Check Environment.yaml file to setup the Python 2 environment
4. Go to the absoulte path which contains Python ipynb file
5. Run boston_hosing.ipynb file with Python 2 kernel 

Version:
